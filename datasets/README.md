In our datasets, we have several CSV files: `train_with_id.csv`, `val_with_id.csv`, `test_with_id.csv`, `source_train_with_id.csv`, `target_test_with_id.csv`, and `target_train_with_id.csv`. These files are extensions of the original datasets in DrugBAN, with the addition of a new column named `pr_id` for  faster retrieving target features.

`drug_high_train.csv` is the drug biased training set, generated by `dataset_drug_high.py`

`0.5tendency_train.csv` is the "balanced" training set, generated by `dataset_avg.py`
